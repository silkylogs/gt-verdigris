This is the specification for the virtual machine of gt-verdigris.
Codenamed "glass", it is a little endian machine with a word size of 32 bits.
Great care has been taken to ensure that all instructions of this version of the ISA fits within 16
bits, while still retaining the potential for backwards compatible extension.

The instruction set
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The possible combinations of instructions with the following criteria is shown below:
- Bytes padded to 32 bits
- Bytes displayed in little endian order
- Numbered in order of evaluation
- Key:
  - x: any hexadecimal literal between 1 to E inclusive
  - R: the register label, between 0 to F inclusive
  - F: the hexadecimal literal F
  - c: a constant hexadecimal number between 0 to F inclusive
1. xR RR __ __             | 
2. Fx RR __ __             |
3. FF xR __ __             |
